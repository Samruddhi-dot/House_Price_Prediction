# House_Price_Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices in California using the California Housing dataset. It leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate price predictions based on geographical and socioeconomic features.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing factors influencing house prices.
- **Model Building**: Implementing regression models like Linear Regression and Random Forests.
- **Evaluation**: Using MAE, MSE, and R-squared metrics to assess performance.
- **Visualization**: Creating heatmaps and price comparison plots.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
